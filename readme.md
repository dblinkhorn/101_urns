You have 101 urns labeled 0 through 100. In urn n, there are n green balls and 100 - n red balls.
A games show host covers up the labels and mixes up the order of the urns. Your goal is to pick 2
balls of the same color. Should you:

- (a) Pick both from one urn
- (b) Pick from different urns
- (c) Doesn't matter

The script performs 100,000 trials each of options a & b and prints the probability that each one will yield matching balls.
